## 🛠️ Installation

### Prerequisites
```bash
# Required Python packages
pip install matplotlib networkx
```

### Clone Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/SauravBhowmick/dijkstra-gps-navigation.git
cd dijkstra-gps-navigation
```

### Quick Start
```python
python gps_navigation.py
```

## 📋 Usage

### 1. Demo Mode (Recommended for First Run)
```python
# Run the complete demonstration
demo_gps_navigation()
```
This will show:
- 3 example routes with detailed analysis
- Interactive route visualization
- Command-line interface for custom navigation

### 2. Find Specific Route
```python
navigator = GPSNavigator()

# Find route from Main St & 1st Ave to Mountain Rd & 3rd Ave
result = navigator.dijkstra(start=0, end=11, verbose=True)

# Display comprehensive route information
navigator.print_route_summary(result, 0, 11)

# Show visual map
navigator.visualize_route(result, 0, 11)
```

### 3. Interactive Navigation
```python
navigator = GPSNavigator()
navigator.interactive_navigation()
```

## 🗺️ City Map Layout

The system includes a realistic city grid with 12 major intersections:

| ID | Location | Coordinates |
|----|----------|-------------|
| 0 | Main St & 1st Ave | (1.0, 5.0) |
| 1 | Park Rd & 2nd Ave | (3.0, 5.2) |
| 2 | Oak St & 3rd Ave | (5.0, 5.1) |
| 3 | Elm St & 1st Ave | (1.2, 4.0) |
| 4 | Pine St & 2nd Ave | (3.1, 3.8) |
| 5 | Maple St & 3rd Ave | (5.2, 4.1) |
| 6 | Broadway & 1st Ave | (1.1, 2.5) |
| 7 | Center St & 2nd Ave | (3.2, 2.3) |
| 8 | Hill Rd & 3rd Ave | (5.3, 2.6) |
| 9 | River St & 1st Ave | (1.3, 1.0) |
| 10 | Lake Ave & 2nd Ave | (3.5, 0.8) |
| 11 | Mountain Rd & 3rd Ave | (5.4, 1.1) |

## 🔧 Algorithm Details

### Dijkstra's Algorithm Implementation
- **Time Complexity**: O((V + E) log V) using binary heap
- **Space Complexity**: O(V) for distance and predecessor tracking
- **Data Structure**: Adjacency list representation
- **Priority Queue**: Python's `heapq` for efficient operations

### Key Components
```python
def dijkstra(self, start, end, verbose=False):
    """
    Find shortest path using Dijkstra's algorithm
    
    Args:
        start (int): Starting node ID
        end (int): Destination node ID
        verbose (bool): Print step-by-step execution
        
    Returns:
        dict: Contains path, distance, visited nodes, and steps
    """
```
